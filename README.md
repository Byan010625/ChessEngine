# ChessEngine
Creating an interactive Chess Engine + UI

NOTE: This is not my code, and I do not take credit for it. This chess engine was built using the tutorial found on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQV5mozTHmaffB0rBsD6m9VN1azgo5wXl. All credit goes to Logic Crazy Chess.

I coded this chess engine using his code as a template as a personal project for myself to understand more about coding a chess engine.

A working/complete version was finished in Summer 2020. I still need to add castling and en pessant.
